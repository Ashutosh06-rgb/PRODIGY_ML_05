# 🍽️ Food Image Recognition & Calorie Estimation

This project is a deep learning model that can accurately **classify food images** and **estimate their calorie content**, helping users track their dietary intake and make informed food choices.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- 🔍 Recognizes 3 food categories: `Biryani`, `Pizza`, and `Burger`
- 🧠 Uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras
- 🔢 Calculates estimated calories based on predicted class and portion size
- 🖼 Trained on a **custom image dataset** collected from the web
- ⚙️ Built and tested entirely on **Google Colab**
